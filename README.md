Hi there 👋

Here's some basic information about the Akynovia-ai project:

- 🤖 Akynovia-ai is a Python script that uses the W3M browser to display information in the Linux terminal.
- 💻 To use the virtual assistant, simply run the `akynovia.py` file in a terminal. The script will start and display a welcome message, followed by a prompt where you can enter commands.
- 🚀 The Akynovia-ai project is open for collaboration and contributions from the community.
- 📝 The Akynovia-ai project is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving the AKYNOVIA virtual assistant and adding new features.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about natural language processing and machine learning.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to Python and artificial intelligence.
- 💬 Ask me about the Akynovia-ai project or any questions related to Python and AI.
- 📫 You can reach me by sending an email.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The name "Akynovia-ai" is derived from "intelligence assistant" and "Akynovia" - where Akynovia is the name of a character in a book I'm working on about artificial intelligence.
